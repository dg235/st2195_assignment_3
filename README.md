# st2195_assignment_3
In this assignment, I will download the Data Expo 2009 data from the Harvard Dataverse and construct an SQLite Database called airline2.db with the following tables:
1. ontime (with the data from 2000 to 2005 â€“ including 2000 and 2005)
2. airports (with the data in airports.csv)
3. carriers (with the data in carriers.csv)
4. planes (with the data in plane-data.csv)

Then I will consrtuct a database and replicate the queries in the practice quiz in both Python and R.
